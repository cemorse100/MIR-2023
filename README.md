# MIR-2023 ASSIGNMENT 1

For this assignment I aimed to reprodce two notebooks which execute a feature extraction and classification of a dataset containing different classes of Mridangam strokes.

These notebooks are applied to a dataset, Medley-Solos-DB (https://zenodo.org/record/1344103#.Y-ufuOzMLlx) which instead contains audio recordings which are classified by the instrument being played.

This datafile contains:

21571 audio clips as WAV files, sampled at 44.1 kHz, with a single channel (mono), at a bit depth of 32.
Fixed duration of 2972 milliseconds, that is, 65536 discrete-time samples.
8 Distinct instrument classes
Here are the tasks performed in these notebooks:

Understanding & balancing the dataset
Feature Extraction
Genre classification
